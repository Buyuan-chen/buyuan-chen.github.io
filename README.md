I am an illustrator from China and now my major is graphic design. Actually write code is a very hard thing for me, i never try this before, i have lots of idea but i cannot turn it be code always make me feel depressed. 
But fortunately, my roommate is a coder who work in NewBedford. So I did resume sketch in indesign at first and tried to write code. Although the process is very difficult, I am very satisfied with the result.
